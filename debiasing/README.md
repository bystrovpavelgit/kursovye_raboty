# debiasing_evaluation
debiasing method evaluation for paper "Gender-preserving Debiasing for Pre-trained Word Embeddings"

Please load debiasing analogies_analysis.ipynb and debiasing analogies_analysis_gp_glove.ipynb notebooks into google colab.
(They can be executed on laptop as well but string "/content/" should be removed from paths)
Initialy Try to run debiasing analogies_analysis.ipynb to generate 2 debiased embeddungs and plot similarity graphs. 

Then run debiasing analogies_analysis_gp_glove.ipynb to run Google Analogies test for GP-glove.

Google Analogies test can take up to 48 hours. There is shorter version of this test in last cell
